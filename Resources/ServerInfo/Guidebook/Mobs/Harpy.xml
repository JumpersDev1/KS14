  Harpies are an avian human mutation, sprouting feathered wings and ruffled tails.
  They see the world through an ultraviolet view, slash with their claws dealing
  [color=#ec3a3a]piercing [/color]damage, and walk around on digitrade legs.
  
  ## Sing your heart out
  
  Harpies are capable of singing out a tune on the spot with their voice, allowing for you to play music wherever you are,
  as long as you aren't muffled
